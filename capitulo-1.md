# Un día muy poco probable

* * * *

*Bajo la luz de la luna un pequeño fragmento de plata devuelve un reflejo, una fracción de una línea...*

*(unas túnicas negras caen al suelo)*

*...la sangre mana a litros, y alguien grita una palabra.*

* * * *

Cada centímetro de la pared está cubierto por una estantería. Cada estantería tiene seis baldas, que llegan casi hasta el techo. Algunas de las baldas rebosan con libros de encuadernación recia: ciencias, matemáticas, historia y cualquier otra cosa. Otras baldas tienen dos filas de libros de ciencia ficción en tapa blanda, con los de atrás apoyados en cajas de pañuelos o pedazos de madera para que se puedan ver sus títulos sobresaliendo por encima de la primera fila. Y aún así no es suficiente. Los libros se acumulan sobre las mesas y los sofás, y forman pequeñas pilas bajo las ventanas.

Esta es la sala de estar de la casa que ocupa el eminente profesor Michael Verres-Evans, y su esposa, la señora Petunia Evans-Verres, y su hijo adoptivo, Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres.

Hay una carta encima de la mesa de la sala de estar, y un sobre de pergamino amarillento, sin matasellos, dirigido al *Sr. H. Potter* en tinta verde esmeralda.

El profesor y su mujer están hablando entre ellos de forma agresiva, pero sin gritarse. El profesor consiera que gritar es de bárbaros.

—Estás de broma— le dijo Michael a Petunia. Su tono indicaba que estaba precupado de que ella hablase en serio.

—Mi hermana era una bruja— repitió Petunia. Parecía asustada, pero aún así aguantaba el tipo. —Su marido era un mago.

—¡Esto es absurdo!— dijo Michael de forma hostil. —Vinieron a nuestra boda, nos visitaban en Navidad...

—Les dije que no debías saberlo— susurró Petunia. —Pero es cierto. He visto cosas que....

El profesor puso los ojos en blanco. “Querida, entiendo que no conoces como yo la literatura escéptica. Puede que no sepas lo fácil que es para un mago entrenado hacer que lo imposible parezca posible. ¿Recuerdas cuando enseñé a Harry a doblar cucharas? Si parecía que sabían siempre lo que estabas pensando, se llama lectura en frío y...”.

—No doblaban cucharas.

—¿Entonces, qué?

Petunia se mordió el labio.

—No puedo simplemente contártelo. Pensarías que estoy...— dijo tragando saliva. —Escucha, Michael. Yo no era...no he sido siempre así— dijo señalándose con un gesto, como indicando su cuerpo flexible. —Lily hizo esto. Porque yo...porque se lo *rogué*. Durante años, se lo rogué. Lily *siempre* fue más guapa que yo, y por eso yo era...desagradable con ella, y entonces descubrió que podía hacer *magia*, ¿puedes hacerte una idea de cómo me sentí? Y le *imploré* que usase algo de esa magia conmigo para que yo también pudiese ser hermosa, para que aunque no tuviese magia como ella, por lo menos pudiese ser hermosa.

Las lágrimas se agolpaban en los ojos de Petunia.

—Y Lily me decía que no, y se inventaba las excusas más ridículas que puedas imaginar (como que el mundo se acabaría si se portaba bien con su hermana, o que un centauro le había dicho que no lo hiciera), las más ridículas, y la odiaba por ello. Y justo cuando acababa de graduarme en la universidad, estaba saliendo con este chico, Vernon Dursley, que estaba gordo y era el único chico que me hablaba. Y decía que quería tener niños, y que su primer hijo se llamaría Dudley. Y yo pensaba: *¿Qué tipo de padre llama a su hijo Dudley Dursley?* Era como si viera todo mi futuro desplegándose delante de mis ojos, y no pude soportarlo. Y escribí a mi hermana y le dije que si no quería ayudarme, simplemente me...

Petunia se detuvo.

—Sea como fuere— dijo Petunia, con un hijo de voz, —por fin cedió. Me dijo que era peligroso, y le dije que ya no me importaba nada, y me dio a beber esta poción que me hizo enfermar durante semanas, pero cuando mejoré, mi piel se volvió suave, y gané peso, y...era guapa, la gente era *agradable* conmigo— su voz se quebró —y después de aquello ya no pude odiar a mi hermana, sobre todo después de conocer lo que la magia le trajo cuando todo acabó...

“Darling,” Michael said gently, “you got sick, you gained some weight while resting in bed, and your skin cleared up on its own. Or being sick made you change your diet—”

“She was a witch,” Petunia repeated. “I saw it.”

“Petunia,” Michael said. The annoyance was creeping into his voice. “You *know* that can’t be true. Do I really have to explain why?”

Petunia wrung her hands. She seemed to be on the verge of tears. “My love, I know I can’t win arguments with you, but please, you have to trust me on this—”

*“Dad! Mum!”*

The two of them stopped and looked at Harry as though they’d forgotten there was a third person in the room.

Harry took a deep breath. “Mum, *your* parents didn’t have magic, did they?”

“No,” Petunia said, looking puzzled.

“Then no one in your family knew about magic when Lily got her letter. How did *they* get convinced?”

“Ah…” Petunia said. “They didn’t just send a letter. They sent a professor from Hogwarts. He—” Petunia’s eyes flicked to Michael. “He showed us some magic.”

“Then you don’t have to fight over this,” Harry said firmly. Hoping against hope that this time, just this once, they would listen to him. “If it’s true, we can just get a Hogwarts professor here and see the magic for ourselves, and Dad will admit that it’s true. And if not, then Mum will admit that it’s false. That’s what the experimental method is for, so that we don’t have to resolve things just by arguing.”

The Professor turned and looked down at him, dismissive as usual. “Oh, come now, Harry. Really, *magic?* I thought *you’d* know better than to take this seriously, son, even if you’re only ten. Magic is just about the most unscientific thing there is!”

Harry’s mouth twisted bitterly. He was treated well, probably better than most genetic fathers treated their own children. Harry had been sent to the best primary schools—and when that didn’t work out, he was provided with tutors from the endless pool of starving students. Always Harry had been encouraged to study whatever caught his attention, bought all the books that caught his fancy, sponsored in whatever maths or science competitions he entered. He was given anything reasonable that he wanted, except, maybe, the slightest shred of respect. A Doctor teaching biochemistry at Oxford could hardly be expected to listen to the advice of a little boy. You would listen to Show Interest, of course; that’s what a Good Parent would do, and so, if you conceived of yourself as a Good Parent, you would do it. But take a ten-year-old *seriously?* Hardly.

Sometimes Harry wanted to scream at his father.

“Mum,” Harry said. “If you want to win this argument with Dad, look in chapter two of the first book of the Feynman Lectures on Physics. There’s a quote there about how philosophers say a great deal about what science absolutely requires, and it is all wrong, because the only rule in science is that the final arbiter is observation—that you just have to look at the world and report what you see. Um… off the top of my head I can’t think of where to find something about how it’s an ideal of science to settle things by experiment instead of arguments—”

His mother looked down at him and smiled. “Thank you, Harry. But—” her head rose back up to stare at her husband. “I don’t want to win an argument with your father. I want my husband to, to listen to his wife who loves him, and trust her just this once—”

Harry closed his eyes briefly. *Hopeless.* Both of his parents were just hopeless.

Now his parents were getting into one of *those* arguments again, one where his mother tried to make his father feel guilty, and his father tried to make his mother feel stupid.

“I’m going to go to my room,” Harry announced. His voice trembled a little. “Please try not to fight too much about this, Mum, Dad, we’ll know soon enough how it comes out, right?”

“Of course, Harry,” said his father, and his mother gave him a reassuring kiss, and then they went on fighting while Harry climbed the stairs to his bedroom.

He shut the door behind him and tried to think.

The funny thing was, he *should* have agreed with Dad. No one had ever seen any evidence of magic, and according to Mum, there was a whole magical world out there. How could anyone keep something like that a secret? More magic? That seemed like a rather suspicious sort of excuse.

It should have been a clean case for Mum joking, lying or being insane, in ascending order of awfulness. If Mum had sent the letter herself, that would explain how it arrived at the letterbox without a stamp. A little insanity was far, far less improbable than the universe really working like that.

Except that some part of Harry was utterly convinced that magic was real, and had been since the instant he saw the putative letter from the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.

Harry rubbed his forehead, grimacing. *Don’t believe everything you think,* one of his books had said.

But this bizarre certainty… Harry was finding himself just *expecting* that, yes, a Hogwarts professor would show up and wave a wand and magic would come out. The strange certainty was making no effort to guard itself against falsification—wasn’t making excuses in advance for why there wouldn’t be a professor, or the professor would only be able to bend spoons.

*Where do you come from, strange little prediction?* Harry directed the thought at his brain. *Why do I believe what I believe?*

Usually Harry was pretty good at answering that question, but in this particular case, he had no *clue* what his brain was thinking.

Harry mentally shrugged. A flat metal plate on a door affords pushing, and a handle on a door affords pulling, and the thing to do with a testable hypothesis is to go and test it.

He took a piece of lined paper from his desk, and started writing.

*Dear Deputy Headmistress*

Harry paused, reflecting; then discarded the paper for another, tapping another millimetre of graphite from his mechanical pencil. This called for careful calligraphy.

*Dear Deputy Headmistress Minerva McGonagall,*

*Or Whomsoever It May Concern:*

*I recently received your letter of acceptance to Hogwarts, addressed to Mr. H. Potter. You may not be aware that my genetic parents, James Potter and Lily Potter (formerly Lily Evans) are dead. I was adopted by Lily’s sister, Petunia Evans-Verres, and her husband, Michael Verres-Evans.*

*I am extremely interested in attending Hogwarts, conditional on such a place actually existing. Only my mother Petunia says she knows about magic, and she can’t use it herself. My father is highly sceptical. I myself am uncertain. I also don’t know where to obtain any of the books or equipment listed in your acceptance letter.*

*Mother mentioned that you sent a Hogwarts representative to Lily Potter (then Lily Evans) in order to demonstrate to her family that magic was real, and, I presume, help Lily obtain her school materials. If you could do this for my own family it would be extremely helpful.*

*Sincerely,*

*Harry James Potter-Evans-Verres.*

Harry added their current address, then folded up the letter and put it in an envelope, which he addressed to Hogwarts. Further consideration led him to obtain a candle and drip wax onto the flap of the envelope, into which, using a penknife’s tip, he impressed the initials H.J.P.E.V. If he was going to descend into this madness, he was going to do it with style.

Then he opened his door and went back downstairs. His father was sitting in the living-room and reading a book of higher maths to show how smart he was; and his mother was in the kitchen preparing one of his father’s favourite meals to show how loving she was. It didn’t look like they were talking to one another at all. As scary as arguments could be, *not arguing* was somehow much worse.

“Mum,” Harry said into the unnerving silence, “I’m going to test the hypothesis. According to your theory, how do I send an owl to Hogwarts?”

His mother turned from the kitchen sink to stare at him, looking shocked. “I—I don’t know, I think you just have to own a magic owl.”

That should’ve sounded highly suspicious, *oh, so there’s no way to test your theory then,* but the peculiar certainty in Harry seemed willing to stick its neck out even further.

“Well, the letter got here somehow,” Harry said, “so I’ll just wave it around outside and call ‘letter for Hogwarts!’ and see if an owl picks it up. Dad, do you want to come and watch?”

His father shook his head minutely and kept on reading. *Of course,* Harry thought to himself. Magic was a disgraceful thing that only stupid people believed in; if his father went so far as to *test* the hypothesis, or even *watch* it being tested, that would feel like *associating* himself with that…

Only as Harry stumped out the back door, into the back garden, did it occur to him that if an owl *did* come down and snatch the letter, he was going to have some trouble telling Dad about it.

*But—well—that can’t* really *happen, can it? No matter what my brain seems to believe. If an owl really comes down and grabs this envelope, I’m going to have worries a lot more important than what Dad thinks.*

Harry took a deep breath, and raised the envelope into the air.

He swallowed.

Calling out *Letter for Hogwarts!* while holding an envelope high in the air in the middle of your own back garden was… actually pretty embarrassing, now that he thought about it.

*No. I’m better than Dad. I will use the scientific method even if it makes me feel stupid.*

“Letter—” Harry said, but it actually came out as more of a whispered croak.

Harry steeled his will, and shouted into the empty sky, *“Letter for Hogwarts! Can I get an owl?”*

“Harry?” asked a bemused woman’s voice, one of the neighbours.

Harry pulled down his hand like it was on fire and hid the envelope behind his back like it was drug money. His whole face was hot with shame.

An old woman’s face peered out from above the neighbouring fence, grizzled grey hair escaping from her hairnet. Mrs. Figg, the occasional babysitter. “What are you doing, Harry?”

“Nothing,” Harry said in a strangled voice. “Just—testing a really silly theory—”

“Did you get your acceptance letter from Hogwarts?”

Harry froze in place.

“Yes,” Harry’s lips said a little while later. “I got a letter from Hogwarts. They say they want my owl by the 31st of July, but—”

“But you don’t *have* an owl. Poor dear! I can’t imagine *what* someone must have been thinking, sending you just the standard letter.”

A wrinkled arm stretched out over the fence, and opened an expectant hand. Hardly even thinking at this point, Harry gave over his envelope.

“Just leave it to me, dear,” said Mrs. Figg, “and in a jiffy or two I’ll have someone over.”

And her face disappeared from over the fence.

There was a long silence in the garden.

Then a boy’s voice said, calmly and quietly, “What.”
